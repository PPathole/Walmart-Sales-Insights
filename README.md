## Introduction

Walmart Sales Insights is a project aimed at exploring Walmart sales data to identify trends, patterns, and insights that can help in decision-making processes. The project involves data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization to provide a comprehensive overview of sales performance across various dimensions such as time, store locations, and external factors.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Trend analysis of total weekly sales over time
- Comparison of sales during holiday and non-holiday weeks
- Identification of top-performing and underperforming stores
- Analysis of the impact of external factors (temperature, fuel price, CPI, unemployment) on sales
- Visualization of sales distribution and correlation between variables
- Heatmap of sales by store and month
- Monthly and yearly sales trends
- Interactive and static visualizations

## Data

The dataset used in this project includes the following columns:

- `Store`: The store number
- `Date`: The week end date
- `Weekly_Sales`: Sales for the given store and week
- `Holiday_Flag`: Indicates whether the week is a special holiday week (1) or not (0)
- `Temperature`: Temperature in the region
- `Fuel_Price`: Cost of fuel in the region
- `CPI`: Consumer Price Index
- `Unemployment`: Unemployment rate

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the necessary libraries. You can install the required:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn psycopg2
```

## Usage

1. **Load Data**: Load the Walmart sales data from the CSV file.

    ```python
    import pandas as pd
    
    # Load data from CSV file into a DataFrame
    csv_file_path = 'path_to_your_csv_file.csv'
    df = pd.read_csv(csv_file_path)
    
    # Convert 'Date' column to datetime format
    df['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Date'], format='%d-%m-%Y')
    ```

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Perform necessary data preprocessing steps such as converting date formats and extracting year and month.

    ```python
    # Extract Year and Month from Date
    df['Year'] = df['Date'].dt.year
    df['Month'] = df['Date'].dt.month
    ```

3. **Visualization**: Create various visualizations to analyze the data.

    ```python
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import seaborn as sns
    
    # Overall Sales Trends
    plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
    sns.lineplot(data=df, x='Date', y='Weekly_Sales', estimator='sum')
    plt.title('Total Weekly Sales Over Time')
    plt.xlabel('Date')
    plt.ylabel('Total Weekly Sales')
    plt.show()
    
    # Add more visualizations as needed...
    ```

4. **Run Analysis**: Execute the Python script to generate insights and visualizations.

## Visualizations

The project includes the following visualizations:

1. **Total Weekly Sales Over Time**
2. **Weekly Sales: Holiday vs Non-Holiday Weeks**
3. **Top Performing Stores**
4. **Sales vs. Temperature**
5. **Sales vs. Fuel Price**
6. **Sales vs. CPI**
7. **Sales vs. Unemployment**
8. **Total Monthly Sales**
9. **Heatmap of Sales by Store and Month**
10. **Distribution of Weekly Sales**
11. **Sales Trends by Store**
12. **Total Yearly Sales**
13. **Correlation Matrix Heatmap**
14. **Sales Trends on Holidays vs. Non-Holidays**
